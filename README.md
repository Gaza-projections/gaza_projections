Welcome to this repository. Every sub-folder on this directory corresponds to a cause-specific module of our report, published at www.gaza-projections.org . The sub-folder `gaza_overall` contains code and data required to do final analysis of all the cause-specific modules together.
During the next few days we will be adding more variable dictionaries and descriptions of code and datasets. Please bear with us while we assemble all of this information.
All of the data contained in this repository are in the public domain, or we have received permission to publish them. The study has received ethics approval from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.

PLEASE NOTE: We are working to modify the code in `gaza_nutrition` so that it can work with aggregate child anthropometry data. While this is happening, we have held back publication of one of the datasets required to replicate the nutrition analysis.
