### General information
Welcome to this repository. Every sub-folder on this directory corresponds to a cause-specific module of our report, published at www.gaza-projections.org . The sub-folder `gaza_overall` contains code and data required to do final analysis of all the cause-specific modules together.

We will be adding more variable dictionaries and descriptions of code and datasets. Please bear with us while we assemble all of this information.

All of the data contained in this repository are in the public domain, or we have received permission to publish them. The study has received ethics approval from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.

To replicate the analysis, please download the entire repository and keep the folder structure as it is. Each folder has an inputs-code-outputs structure. All input files are contained in the '/inputs' sub-folder, while all the code is in the '/code' sub-folder and all outputs (data files, tables, graphs) are saved to '/outputs'/ Analyses in R can be re-run from the 'gaza_[xxx]_00_master_script.R' code, which will load packages and source all other scripts. The directory for reading and outputting files is set automatically when gaza_[xxx]_00_master_script.R is run. An updated version of R software should be installed (https://www.r-project.org/). We recommend to run the code from the open-source RStudio interface (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Both R and RStudio are free and open-source.
